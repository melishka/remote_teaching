This is the repository where I am writing my slides related to remote teaching.  

# What is Remote Teaching?
This is the term I am using to describe emergency, temporary teaching of a course online.  It is distinct from an online course, in that the remote class is designed to be taught in person and is likely to be mainly taught in person.
